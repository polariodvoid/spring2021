## Notebooks

* [introduction.ipynb](./introduction.ipynb)
    * Use the link at the top of the notebook to open it automatically in Google Colab.
    * Based on [Raschka ch01.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch01/ch01.ipynb)
    * Introductory material is based on the reading from Chapter 1 of Raschka & Mirjalili, 3rd Edition.
    * Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning
    * Predicting class labels
    * Roadmap for building machine learning systems
    * Basic terminology for the Iris dataset
    * Some of this should be review from 601, but don't worry about it if you haven't seen it before
* [toolset.ipynb](./toolset.ipynb)
    * Review topics using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib -- demos using the classic Iris dataset
    * Random number generators and 2-D covariance
    * Supervised learning introductory concepts -- classification and regression
    * Introduction to object-oriented programming with Python
* [perceptron.ipynb](./perceptron.ipynb)
    * This is a stripped-down version parts of [Raschka's ch02.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch02/ch02.ipynb)
    * Focus is on the perceptron (first few cells of ch02.ipynb)
    * Detailed explanations are in the book
